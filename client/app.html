    Idea:

    Drazzle (Drawing Puzzle)

    Have you ever played one of these slide games? Such as the gnome glider on RuneScape? Well that is what drazzle is.
    Except it's lots cooler. You can play it alone, or with friends, against the world or in groups.

    Single Gameplay (level-based):
    Drazzle gets a random image from your or your friends' facebook account. It scrambles it up in to pieces.
    The higher level you are on, the more pieces your puzzles will be scrambled in. You will then get extra points if you also guess who's picture it is.

    Double Gameplay (Player VS Player)
    We have 2 types of gameplay, one is time-based random puzzle (competitive), and the second one is draw puzzle (fun).
    In the time-based random puzzle, you will both get the same image. The person to finish it the fastests builds up points.
    In the draw puzzle, you draw something for your friend, and you say what it is supposed to be. It is then scrambled in to pieces and
    your friend has to first finish the puzzle, and then say what it is.

    You can also send an image from your phone to be puzzled by your friends.

    Group gameplay
    Group gameplay is possible in the exact way as above with the time based puzzles, first one to fix the puzzle wins.
    The draw one is a little more complicated, the drawing turn rotates, and if everybody gets it right the drawer gains bonus points.
    Of course the persons to get it right will also get points.

    Topscore gameplay
    We have both multiplayer and single player scores from above explanations. This is what we will both send to the top scores.

   Special Moves:
   Revert Moves (5x)
